## IMPORTANT
Please note that backend has been implemented for this website. NodeJS and Express have been used for the backend and MongoDB has been used for the database.  
However, server.js file does not work in the above mentioned github pages-hosted url, since I do not have knowledge on how to host the server separately from the frontend. 
Only the frontend has been hosted on github pages.  
To see the backend in action, please follow the steps:
* Clone this repository using ```git clone```.
* Run  
```
npm install
npm start
```
* Open another terminal and run
```
node server
```
Follow these steps to make the backend work.

## Framework
ReactJS has been used. Visit [React](https://reactjs.org/).  
NodeJS, Express and Mongoose have been used for the backend.
